    // 1. Yes it's legal but not a good identifier because it could be seen as a variable
    //      or string and classes are idenified from the capital letter
    // 2. Yes it's legal and seems like a good idenifier for the program
    // 3. No it's not legal because you cannot start a class name with a number
    // 4. Yes it's legal but the underscores seem unneccessary 
    // 5. No it's not legal because the astrix already has its own operation in java
    // 6. Yes it's legal but it's not a good identifier because you don't know what the
    //      program is about, it's not descriptive
    // 7. No it's not legal because the exclamation point already stands for not 
    //      equal to in java
